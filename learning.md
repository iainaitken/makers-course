## Starting level

My starting point is some experience coding with C, Python, JavaScript, SQL and Ruby, gained from:

* Harvard CS50 course
* Makers pre-course
* Codeacademy Ruby course
* Ruby Koans
* Codewars (Ruby)

I have a small amount of experience of TDD gained from the Makers pre-course.

I understand basic coding concepts such as algorithmic thinking, but lack the skills and experience to properly write clean code and create fully-functional programs.

#### 1. I can make anything

##### 1.1 I can TDD anything

I have some experience with Ruby and RSpec, but nowhere near enough to be able to make a complex, well-written program.

##### 1.2 I can program fluently

My code is not great. I don't have the required knowledge to write clean code.

##### 1.3 I can debug anything

I understand what debugging is and mostly debug my own simple programs.

##### 1.4 I can model anything

I don't have a full understanding of what the term 'model' means in this specific context.

##### 1.5 I can refactor anything

I can refactor some things, but do not have anywhere near enough experience to be able to refactor anything.

##### 1.6 I have a methodical approach to solving problems

I have a tendency to jump ahead rather than methodically work through every step to solve a problem.

#### 2. I'm equipped for long-term growth

##### 2.1 I manage my own wellbeing

I am generally quite good at this; I make sure that time is dedicated to exercise, family and things I enjoy outside of work.

##### 2.2 I can learn anything by myself

I am reasonably good at this, but don't record learning in a structured manner.

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

##### 3.1 I use an agile product development process

I don't know what agile development is.

##### 3.2 I write code that is easy to change

I almost certainly don't do this.

##### 3.3 I can justify the way I work

I suspect not.

##### 3.4 I grow collaboratively

I have a lot of experience of working with, training, and mentoring others and look forward to using these skills on the course.

## Weekly Progress

### Week 1

[Airtable: TDD & Debugging](https://airtable.com/shrIlMSX4PrGxuSfT/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6)

#### I can TDD anything

Practising TDD with the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

Need more experience in writing tests fluently with RSpec, and understanding some of the more complex concepts such as mocking behaviour.

#### I can program fluently

Writing code in the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

I need to plan out my programs more thoroughly before writing any code - I need to think more clearly about what the objects in the code will be, and what each will be responsible for.

#### I can debug anything

Debugging in the [Boris Bikes](https://github.com/iainaitken/boris_bikes_friday) and [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenges.

Debugging is going well. I am using a methodical approach to debugging and have managed to find all bugs that cropped up this week.

#### I can refactor anything

Some refactoring in the [Airport](https://github.com/iainaitken/airport_challenge) challenge.

#### I have a methodical approach to solving problems

See debugging above.

#### I manage my own wellbeing

Attending meditation classes; regular exercise; switching off in the evenings.

Need to improve this, though - spend both weekend days working on course-related tasks. Aim to work more effectively during week 2, to ensure that one of the weekend days is free from programming.

#### I can learn anything by myself

Independently working through the udemy RSpec course and recording progress [here](https://github.com/iainaitken/courses/tree/main/udemy/testing_ruby).

#### I grow collaboratively

Plenty of opportunities to pair program this week, including outside of the allocated time in the afternoons for this skill. I made an effort to learn how to collaborate on git and try out the driver/navigator style of pair programming.  See the [feedback document](https://github.com/iainaitken/makers-course/blob/main/feedback.md) for feedback received during this week.

### Week 2

[Airtable: TDD & OOD](https://airtable.com/shrr9VqhGBzPyfa7E/tblokmw6yNUO75ge6)

#### 1. I can make anything

##### 1.1 I can TDD anything

Practised with the oystercard task throughout the week, and finished with [takeaway](https://github.com/iainaitken/takeaway-challenge).

##### 1.2 I can program fluently

Becoming much more fluent with programming, as shown by [takeaway](https://github.com/iainaitken/takeaway-challenge). Using more advanced OO and TDD principles such as dependency injection, encapsulation and mocking.

##### 1.3 I can debug anything

Extensive debugging practice throughout the week with oystercard and [takeaway](https://github.com/iainaitken/takeaway-challenge).

##### 1.4 I can model anything

[Modelling workshop](https://github.com/makersacademy/skills-workshops/tree/master/object_oriented_programming/domain_model_diagramming)

Practised modelling with the [weekend challenge](https://github.com/iainaitken/takeaway-challenge).

##### 1.5 I can refactor anything

Extensive refactoring practice throughout the week with oystercard; learned about refactoring patterns (extract variable, method and class).

Need more practice with this.

#### 2. I'm equipped for long-term growth

##### 2.1 I manage my own wellbeing

Continuing to exercise regularly and eat healthily; was better this week at not working all through the weekend.

##### 2.2 I can learn anything by myself

Made progress with the udemy Rspec course; see also [takeaway](https://github.com/iainaitken/takeaway-challenge), in particular learning how to integrate Twilio into a project.

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

##### 3.2 I write code that is easy to change

Learning how to use concepts such as dependency injection to write code that is easy to change; making more of an effort to avoid hard-coding in the test suite.

##### 3.4 I grow collaboratively

5 pair programming sessions completed this week, with good [feedback](https://github.com/iainaitken/makers-course/blob/main/feedback.md).

---

### Week 3

#### 1. I can make anything

Main focus for this week was [Battle](https://github.com/iainaitken/battle_2) and [RPS](https://github.com/iainaitken/rps-challenge).

##### 1.1 I can TDD anything

Great progress on this - I completed both Battle and RPS. I have a way to go before I can do this without referring to course materials, but I did successfully complete the weekend challenge, including one of the bonus user stories.

I do need much more practice with HTML and CSS - i.e. the front end.

##### 1.2 I can program fluently

Feedback from the weekend challenge was that my code is clean and easy to read; I am definitely making progress towards this goal.

##### 1.3 I can debug anything

Plenty of practice with this throughout the week - successfully debugged every issue that cropped up.

##### 1.4 I can model anything

Modelling still needs a lot of work, but I did practice modelling on the weekend challenge.

##### 1.5 I can refactor anything

As usual, the work during the afternoon pairing sessions involved significant refactoring.

However, I am pleased with my work on RPS as I first attempted it and then refactored once I'd looked again at the final few lessons of Battle. This meant my code needed significant refactoring, but I did this successfully and then refactored again to make the game multiplayer.

##### 1.6 I have a methodical approach to solving problems

Steadily improving here; I force myself to stop and methodically review steps to date to check understanding and find bugs.

#### 2. I'm equipped for long-term growth

##### 2.1 I manage my own wellbeing

Need to work on this, in particular setting aside time for myself at the weekend.

##### 2.2 I can learn anything by myself

Still improving RSpec skills through the udemy course, and generally improving my overall web development knowledge.

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

##### 3.2 I write code that is easy to change

See 1.5 above.

##### 3.4 I grow collaboratively

Worked with others on the pair programming sessions, including two sessions where my pair was significantly behind. I helped

### Week 4

The goals for week 4 were:

* Build a simple web app with a database
* Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
* Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships between tables)

I feel that I have met these goals, although I did not get to learn or practice incorporating the ability for a user to sign up to/log in/log out of a web app.

#### 1. I can make anything

##### 1.1 I can TDD anything

See [chitter challenge](https://github.com/iainaitken/chitter-challenge) - a simple web app. See also count sinatra. I need to work on front-end styling and user logins. I followed TDD protocols when building the app and achieved ~98% test coverage (only two lines weren't covered, and those were the lines that choose the development database and so can't be tested in the test suite?)

##### 1.2 I can program fluently

I found SQL this week to be very easy to pick up, and I feel that I can fluently program SQL commands. I need practice with more advanced SQL syntax.

##### 1.3 I can debug anything

Some practice debugging in the afternoon challenges; also successfully solved all bugs in the weekend challenge.

##### 1.4 I can model anything

Need more practice with modelling, although did learn about CRC cards this week, and practised using those on the weekend challenge.

##### 1.5 I can refactor anything

Some practice refactoring during the afternoon challenges.

#### 2. I'm equipped for long-term growth

##### 2.1 I manage my own wellbeing

Kept aside one day for me this weekend, at the expense of not completing the weekend challenge.

#### 3. I help my teams succeed

##### 3.2 I write code that is easy to change

Making progress towards this goal. My weekend challenge code was easy to change and refactor where necessary.

##### 3.4 I grow collaboratively

Helped colleagues during the afternoon challenges.
