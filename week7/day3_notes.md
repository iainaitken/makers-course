### Lunchtime talk

Standard interview

* Take home test
* Pair programming interview
* Values/behavioural interview
* Architecture and design

Take home test - looking at design, test coverage, whether you document assumptions etc. This might be by including a readme, or sending the assumptions to the recruiter. Format is important.

THe pair interview you will go through your solution and then you will work on extending that solution. Interviewer will be looking at how well you interact with people, how you react to feedback, what your developer process is.

1. Walk through submission at beginning.
2. Think out loud.
3. Ask clarifying questions.
4. Don't be afraid to ask for help - this is one of the things they will be looking for.

The values interview is non-technical. Listen to the question, answer with real-life examples. Don't waffle.

Architecture/design - remember, the recruiter is not looking for a perfect solution but rather how you think about thinks - trade-offs, scalability, etc. THink of TDD - start small and increment upwards. Use the whiteboard - it makes it easier for the interviewer to understand what you are saying.

Be open about what you don't know.

Interviewers are nervous too, they want you to do well. The interview is a conversation - ask loads of questions about the company too. Check that you've answered the question.

Practice interviewing by applying for jobs you don't care about.
