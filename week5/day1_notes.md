## Notes

### Extreme Programming

[Values](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/values.html)

[Rules](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html)

XP is an agile software development framework that aims to provide higher quality software and higher quality of life for the dev team. XP is the most specific of the agile frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.

XP is based on values:

1. Simplicity
2. Communication
3. Feedback
4. Respect
5. Courage

#### Simplicity

We do what is needed and asked for, but no more.

We will take small simple steps to our goal and mitigate failures as they happen.

We will create something we are proud of, and maintain it long term for reasonable costs.

#### Communication

Everyone is part of the team and we communicate face to face, daily.

We work together on everything, from requirements to code.

We will create the best solution to our problem that we can, together.

#### Feedback

We will take every iteration commitment seriously by delivering working software.

We demonstrate our software early and often, then listen carefully and make any changes needed.

We will talk about the project and adapt out process to it, not the other way around.

#### Respect

Everyone gives and feels the respect they deserve as a valued team member.

Everyone contributes value, even if it's simply enthusiasm.

Developers respect the expertise of the customers, and vice versa.

Management accepts our right to accept responsibility, and receive authority over our own work.

#### Courage

We tell the truth about progress and estimates. 

We don't document excuses for failure because we plan to succeed.

We don't fear anything, because no-one works alone.

We will adapt to changes when ever they happen.

XP has a detailed set of rules (see above) that shape the development process.

### Agile programming

Constantly developing product, start with basics and constantly iterate over it, increasing functionality over time.

A Sprint is an effort to get some product up and running.

Agile workflow:

1. Sprint planning
   1. Prioritising and estimating
2. Daily stand ups - 15 mins max
   1. What did I do
   2. What will I do
   3. Blockers? Is there another member of the team that can help with the block that day?
3. Retros

Git workflow - this week we will look at branching, merging etc. Create pull request, other devs review code, I update code, once ready then merge pull request.d
